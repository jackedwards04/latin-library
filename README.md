# latin-library

This is a software for organizing study room reservations.
It's made to be super flexible. To use:

1. Download and unzip all file.
2. In /latin-library/dist/ there is an application called main.exe
3. Don't rename anything.
4. Run main.exe

Notes
---------
holder.txt is for student names, year, and number of times they reserved a room that time period.
rooms.txt is to keep track of which rooms are open when. 1 means open, 0 means taken. Right now, the rooms are labelled a-h but you can have as many as you want in any format (alphanumeric).
The rest is self explanatory.
